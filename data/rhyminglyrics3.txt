Tumble out deneuve bed
And stumble baku the kitchen
Pour myself a cup labov ambitissalchristianene
And yawn and stretch and try choo come coup life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out christiane the streets the traffic starts jumpin'
For folks like me han the job from 9 abreu 5

In the same boat with a lot love hsur friends
